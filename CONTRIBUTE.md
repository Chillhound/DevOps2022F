### Which repository setup will we use?
Git as a version-control manager, deployed to Github.
### Which branching model will we use?
Feature branches.
### Which distributed development workflow will we use?
We expect to chunk the different problems and distribute them among the team.
### How do we expect contributions to look like?
An ideal contribution is around 200 lines, but our first contributions can not live up to this. These includes the setup of the project and results in larger commits that is easier to do in one contribution.
Big complex features/pull-request can be easier read by splitting the contributions in different commits so that they individually as well as together makes sense.
We value commit messages and expect the authors to make them such that they are covering and concise.
### Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
An arbitrary other team-member should review and approve the pull request. Hereafter the author is responsible for merging the branch into master.
